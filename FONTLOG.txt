FONTLOG for DINish font family
------------------------
This file provides detailed information on the DINish font software.
This information should be distributed along with the DINish fonts
and any derivative works.

The DINish font is derived from Altinn-DIN, which in turn is based on
Datto's D-DIN. Datto commissioned Monotype to create D-DIN, designed by
Charles Nix, and open sourced it. The font is made available under the
SIL Open Font License v1.1.

Introduction

The name DINish refers to the fact that the typeface looks like DIN
1451. Actually, a quick comparison with the standard as can be found
in historic sources shows DINish to not be fully compatible with the
standard, at least not as it was in 1936. That is probably a good thing.

Reading the DIN 1451 standard with modern eyes reveals that it is
more like a lettering standard for technical drawings than a typeface
specification. The standard has no concern for how the brain processes
shapes and whitespace. DINish was drawn with the human reader in
mind, with subtle but loving exceptions to the rigid grid-and-ruler
specification from the Deutsche Norm. That said, it retains DIN's clarity
and as such it is a typeface with a purpose, if not a mission.

DINish is available in three widths: standard, Condensed and Expanded. The
standard width roughly matches DIN Mittelschrift, the Condensed width
roughly matches the DIN Engschrift, and Expanded is like DIN Breitschrift
(rarely used in Germany, actually). There are Regular, Bold and Italic
variants; the only combination that is missing is Condensed Italic.

Historic roots

DIN 1451 is a sans-serif typeface that is widely used for traffic,
administrative and technical applications. It was defined by the German
standards body DIN - Deutsches Institut fur Normung (German Institute for
Standardization) in the standard sheet DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces) in
1931. Similar standards existed for stencilled letters.

Originally designed for industrial uses, the first DIN-type fonts were a
simplified design that could be applied with limited technical difficulty.
Due to the design's legibility and uncomplicated, unadorned design, it has
become popular for general purpose use in signage and display adaptations.
Many adaptations and expansions of the original design have been released
digitally.

Datto uses a DIN-font as primary corporate font and commissioned Monotype to
create several styles, for internal use and to be open sourced under a SIL
OFL v1.1 license.

Altinn changed the reserved font names from "D-DIN" to "Altinn-DIN"
to be able to do modifications, as required by the SIL OFL v1.1 license.
Pursuant to the same license, the name had to be changed yet again
to drop the reserved font names. Hopefully, DINish will stick.

DINish currently provides the following Unicode coverage:
- Basic Latin: complete
- Latin-1 Supplement: complete
- Plus ISO 8859-15 characters missing in the above.

ChangeLog
---------
(This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)

2025-02-07 - v4.006:
 * Fix handling of minus in the Italic axis (#15).

2025-01-28 - v4.005:
 * Fix kerning issues with T (#14), math alignment (#15) and a-ring in ss02 (#16).
 * Improve variable font axis descriptions.
2024-12-23 - v4.004:
 * Add Black weight (static instance only)
 * Released early, because the release of v4.003 contained corrupt files.
2024-12-20 - v4.003:
 * Remove "Regular" from the internal font name (variable font only).
2024-12-18 - v4.002:
 * Align the terminals of C and S across the entire family. Closes #12.
2024-12-15 - v4.001:
 * Add static fonts with weights 300, 500, 600 and 800.
 * Include a variable font with weight, width and slant axis.
 * Build process reworked to use Docker Compose.
 * Tons of minor changes for consistency.
 * Prepare for adding 100, 200 and 900 weights.
 * Drop the italics font source.
2024-07-19 - v3.008:
 * Add BoldItalic variants. Closes #6.
 * Add ustraightcyrillic and Ustraightcyrillic for Mongolian.
 * Clean up postscript and hhea tables for consistency between family members.
2024-07-04 - v3.007:
 * Rename the internal font name back to DINish, for consistency with the marketing name. Closes #8.
2024-06-09 - v3.006:
 * Integrate Cyrillic glyphs & features by Stefan Peev. Supports multiple languages, including Bulgarian.
 * Remove bogus NULL glyphs from DinishCondensed.
 * Many minor cleanups for issues flagged by fontbakery.
 * Fixes for iacute, jacute, kacute and Dutch accented ij.
2024-04-28 - v3.005:
 * Full support for frac feature.
2023-11-26 - v3.004:
 * Extended Cyrillic and extended Latin.
 * Combining all plain source files in one VFC font and creating a variable version together with static versions.
 Unreleased due to production issues.
2023-11-16 - v3.003:
 * Cyrillic glyphs for Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian languages in Dinish (normal).
 * Interpolation between Regular and Bold for creation of the following instances: Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold.
 Unreleased due to production issues.
2022-07-23 - v3.002:
 * Add glyphs for uppercase Esszet, Dutch IJ digraph in upper and
   lowercase, U with breve and dotless j. Most text processing
   software will not use the IJ digraph unless you use the
   specific Unicode character: 0132 for IJ or 0133 for ij.
 * Add ss01 stylistic alternative to use the IJ digraph for Dutch text.
 * Fix a few minor quality issues.
2022-07-10 - v3.001:
 * Breaking change: Rework vertical metrics to get rid of the
   typo metrics hack. All vertical metrics are now equal. This causes
   line spacing to increase slightly, dependent on platform. Hopefully,
   this will eliminate the need to touch the metrics in the future.
 * Redesign ogonek based on community feedback
 * Address Fontbakery glyf_nested_components concerns
 * Fix a few minor quality issues
2021-10-22 - v2.013:

2021-09-19 - v2.011:
 * Add missing glyphs for around 50 languages.
 * Add full support for Romanian, including language sensitive substitutions.
 * DINish now fully supports all European Latin languages on
   https://r12a.github.io/app-charuse/.  In total, 170 languages are
   supported. Please open an issue on Github if any European language
   based on Latin characters is not rendered with proper typographical
   conventions. And yes, feel free to use DINish for the next Romanian
   bank notes.
2021-09-07 - v2.010:

   to ease maintenance.
2021-09-01 - v2.009: Add old style numerals.
2021-08-30 - v2.008: Add old style numerals (release pulled because of production issues).

 * Fix erroneous Unicode hex value for breve.
 * Fix a few spacing inconsistencies.
 * Straighten up some math symbols in DINish Condensed Italic for consistency.
2021-06-09 - v2.006: Add DINish Condensed Italic to complete the family
2021-06-06 - v2.005: Add missing glyphs for Turkish language, add lower case alpha

2021-04-13 - v2.002: Renamed to DINish, cleaned up for submission to Google Fonts
* Vertical metrics were made consistent within the family (this is an
  incompatible change, but makes rendering consistent when mixing fonts
  from the DINish family in a single line).
* Glyph names were made consistent.
* Many glyphs were re-arranged to reduce fontbakery warnings and fails,
  to make editing and reviewing in TruFont easier, and potentially
  avoid rendering issues.
* Some empty font slots were eliminated.
* Some new glyphs were created to make the family consistent and meet
  Google's requirements.
2021-04-03 - v2.001: Converted to ufo, see NOTES.md

Bert Driehuis converted the font sources to UFO format, and cleaned up the
font to hopefully meet the standards for Google Fonts.

This font is based on Altinn-DIN. Altinn added missing glyphs and released the
source in FontForge format.

This font is based on Datto D-DIN.

D-DIN is based on a Monotype-font that Datto acquired to be open
sourced. Design: Charles Nix (Monotype).
